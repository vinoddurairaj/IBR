	Here is the license stuffs.

	create_key.c has the function that create a key. Note that 
create_key.c will not compile as-is because it depends on a data structure
which has the configuration info. This data structure is a part of
the HA+ configuration data structure and it will take too much time for me
to trim it down to include it in this distribution. 

	misc.c has a function called check_key() that can be used to verify
the key.
