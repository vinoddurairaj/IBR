This README is directed to first time developers using an exported
version of Legato Replication. This file is included in the Legato
Replication source tree.

Legato Replication uses CVS as its source code management tool.  The
Legato Replacation source tree is exported to you as a CVS repository.
It is populated with:
1) The base revision of Replication V 4.4
2) A branch (Branch_AIX43) that represents some of the changes for
   porting Replication V4.4 to AIX.  V4.4 was never released on AIX.
3) A snapshot of Build 112 (tagged as Build_112)
4) A snapshot of Build 114 (tagged as Build_114)
5) A few files newer than the 114 build to support bug fixes

To customize Legato Replication for your company you must
modify several files that contain the "branding" information for
the product.  These files exist in ftdsrc/rebrand.  The
branding information for previous brands of Replication has
been included as examples to aid you in customizing your brand
of the product.

Once you have completed the customization process, run "make rebrand"
in the ftdsrc/rebrand directory.  Then return to ftdsrc and run "make".
This will build the replication product.

Build prerequisites:
1) OS specific compilation tools (native tools provided by OS vendor)
2) GNU compatible version of make
3) The build environment must be one of Solaris 7, SOlaris 8, HP-UX 11.00
