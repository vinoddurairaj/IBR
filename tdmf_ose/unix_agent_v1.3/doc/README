This document is a quick guide of how to get started Unix Agent for Replicator OSE.
Note: You should set up this Unix Agent as a Super User.


<====== Case 1: for Solaris platform ======>  

1) Installation Dependency

Solaris Agent "SFTKdua" will not be installed successfully without SFTKdtc 
installed on the system prior to "SFTKdua".
Even though pkgadd command let you continue the installation without having 
SFTKdtc installed prior, the installation process will fail at the end like 
below:

    # pkgadd -d ./SFTKdua.pkg
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

    +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

2) Setting up a Solaris Agent Environment

 [/etc/opt/SFTKdua/dtcAgent.cfg]

  At first, you need to edit the Solaris Agent configuration file.
  The configuration file is located at "/etc/opt/SFTKdua/dtcAgent.cfg".
  This file will be created by Solaris Agent package at the installation.

  The following parameters must be modified to suit your system.

        mask
        CollectorIP
        CollectorPort
        BabSize

        - Specify the Broadcast address to "mask".
        - Specify the Internet Protocol address of Collector's system to
          "CollectorIP".
        - If the default port number 576 has been changed at the Collector 
	  Installation, the "CollectorPort" parameter also needs to 
	  be changed.
        - Specify the initial value of BAB to "BabSize". This value
          is a megabyte unit.
          If you are building BAB for the first time, Agent will refer this 
	  value. However Agent will not refer this value if the BAB is 
	  already built.

    Example:
    # vi /etc/opt/SFTKdua/dtcAgent.cfg
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | mask:172.255.255.255							|
    | CollectorIP:171.22.33.44							|
    | CollectorPort:576								|
    | BabSize:32								|
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 [/etc/services]

  Secondly, you must edit the "/etc/services" file.
  The Solaris Agent needs the following definition:

    # vi /etc/services
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | dtcListener     10112/udp       # FIX port addr				|
    | dtcAgent        577/tcp         # Arbitrary port number			|
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  If you do not make any modification for the above section, Solaris Agent 
  will use the following values as default:

        dtcListener :10112
        dtcAgent    :577

3) Starting Solaris Agent
  Solaris Agent will start up automatically when the system is booted.
  If you would like to start it up manually, please type the following command:

     # /etc/init.d/SFTKdua start

4) Stopping Solaris Agent
  Solaris Agent will stop automatically when the system is shutdown.
  If you would like to stop manually, please type the following command:

     # /etc/init.d/SFTKdua stop

5) Uninstall
  If you would like to uninstall this package, please type the following command:
  
     # pkgrm SFTKdua

6) Notes
    - Solaris Agent output messages to the following two files.
      Please refer these files when you get some problem.
      (if the file size is 0, there is no output).
 	 "/var/opt/SFTKdua/'MMDD.YY'"
	 "/tmp/dtcAgent.log"
	  ('MMDD.YY' means MM(Month), DD(Date), and YY(Year) respectively.)


<====== Case 2: for AIX platform ======>  

1) Installation Dependency

AIX Agent "SFTKdua" will not be installed successfully without SFTKdtc 
installed on the system prior to "SFTKdua".
The installation without having SFTKdtc installed prior, the installation 
process will fail at the end like below:

    # installp -l -d .

2) Setting up a AIX Agent Environment

 [/etc/dua/lib/dtcAgent.cfg]

  At first, you need to edit the AIX Agent configuration file.
  The configuration file is located at "/etc/dua/lib/dtcAgent.cfg".
  This file will be created by AIX Agent package at the installation.

  The following parameters must be modified to suit your system.

        mask
        CollectorIP
        CollectorPort
        BabSize

        - Specify the Broadcast address to "mask".
        - Specify the Internet Protocol address of Collector's system to
          "CollectorIP".
        - If the default port number 576 has been changed at the Collector 
	  Installation, the "CollectorPort" parameter also needs to 
	  be changed.
        - Specify the initial value of BAB to "BabSize". This value
          is a megabyte unit.
          If you are building BAB for the first time, Agent will refer this 
	  value. However Agent will not refer this value if the BAB is 
	  already built.

    Example:
    # vi /etc/dua/lib/dtcAgent.cfg
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | mask:172.255.255.255							|
    | CollectorIP:171.22.33.44							|
    | CollectorPort:576								|
    | BabSize:32								|
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 [/etc/services]

  Secondly, you must edit the "/etc/services" file.
  The AIX Agent needs the following definition:

    # vi /etc/services
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | dtcListener     10112/udp       # FIX port addr				|
    | dtcAgent        577/tcp         # Arbitrary port number			|
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  If you do not make any modification for the above section, AIX Agent 
  will use the following values as default:

        dtcListener :10112
        dtcAgent    :577

3) Starting AIX Agent
  AIX Agent will start up automatically when the system is booted.
  If you would like to start it up manually, please type the following command:

     # /etc/dua/init.d/SFTKdua start

4) Stopping AIX Agent
  AIX Agent will stop automatically when the system is shutdown.
  If you would like to stop manually, please type the following command:

     # /etc/dua/init.d/SFTKdua stop

5) Uninstall
  If you would like to uninstall this package, please type the following command:
  
     # installp -u dua

6) Notes
    - AIX Agent output messages to the following two files.
      Please refer these files when you get some problem.
      (if the file size is 0, there is no output).
 	 "/var/dua/'MMDD.YY'"
	 "/tmp/dtcAgent.log"
	  ('MMDD.YY' means MM(Month), DD(Date), and YY(Year) respectively.)

<====== Case 3: for HP-UX platform ======>  

1) Installation Dependency

HP-UX Agent "SFTKdua" will not be installed successfully without SFTKdtc 
installed on the system prior to "SFTKdua".
Even though pkgadd command let you continue the installation without having 
SFTKdtc installed prior, the installation process will fail at the end like 
below:

    # swinstall -s /<CD-ROM_mount_point>/DUA.depot
	swinstall opens the following dialog box.
    	- Highlight the DUA package from the list. Select Mark for Install from the Action menu.
	- From the Actions menu, select Install (analysis). The Warning dialog appears as follows:

        CollectorIP
        CollectorPort
        BabSize

        - Specify the Broadcast address to "mask".
        - Specify the Internet Protocol address of Collector's system to
          "CollectorIP".
        - If the default port number 576 has been changed at the Collector 
	  Installation, the "CollectorPort" parameter also needs to 
	  be changed.
        - Specify the initial value of BAB to "BabSize". This value
          is a megabyte unit.
          If you are building BAB for the first time, Agent will refer this 
	  value. However Agent will not refer this value if the BAB is 
	  already built.

    Example:
    # vi /etc/opt/SFTKdua/dtcAgent.cfg
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | mask:172.255.255.255							|
    | CollectorIP:171.22.33.44							|
    | CollectorPort:576								|
    | BabSize:32								|
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 [/etc/services]

  Secondly, you must edit the "/etc/services" file.
  The Linux Agent needs the following definition:

    # vi /etc/services
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | dtcListner     10112/udp       # FIX port addr				|
    | dtcAgent       577/tcp         # Arbitrary port number			|
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  If you do not make any modification for the above section, Linux Agent 
  will use the following values as default:

        dtcListner :10112
        dtcAgent   :577

3) Starting Linux Agent
  Linux Agent will start up automatically when the system is booted.
  If you would like to start it up manually, please type the following command:

     # /etc/init.d/SFTKdua start

4) Stopping Linux Agent
  Linux Agent will stop automatically when the system is shutdown.
  If you would like to stop manually, please type the following command:

     # /etc/init.d/SFTKdua stop

5) Uninstall
  If you would like to uninstall this package, please type the following command:
  
     # rpm -e SFTKdua-Linux-2.1.0-003

6) Notes
    - Linux Agent output messages to the following two files.
      Please refer these files when you get some problem.
      (if the file size is 0, there is no output).
 	 "/var/opt/SFTKdua/'MMDD.YY'"
	 "/tmp/dtcAgent.log"
	  ('MMDD.YY' means MM(Month), DD(Date), and YY(Year) respectively.)
